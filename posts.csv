"Using AI to write content for your business is dumber than pitching a tent next to an active volcano. News flash, AI isn't good at writing. Anyone who thinks it is probably thinks ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is scholarly literature. AI is LITERALLY designed to be average. But in the world of marketing, average doesn't cut it. In the past 5 years, I've gotten: - Billionaires to answer cold emails - Social media posts to get 10s of millions of views - Investors to give me millions of dollars I did this by writing good copy. By sounding different. The fastest-growing startups in the world realize this. They don't rely on AI because they know content is more competitive than ever. Listen, I won't stop you from posting slop into the void of social media. But if you don't want to do that, I've helped dozens of companies get millions of views on LinkedIn by making unique content.

"Last year I hired 3 convicted felons to work for my company. At first, many of my existing employees were nervous. I couldn't blame them. These men had a history of violent crimes & one of them even has a tear-shaped tattoo. But since hiring them, my team has never worked harder. Why? Because fear is the greatest motivator. My employees know that these 3 guys would do anything for me. I mean ANYTHING… The best part is, I don't even give the felons tasks. Just having them sit around the office has increased productivity by 35%. The workforce has changed in 2026. Ping pong tables & Friday pizza parties don't motivate people like they used to. It's time to try new creative strategies to get your team to work harder. Subscribe to my newsletter for more unhinged business satire: https://lnkd.in/ekGih-Hf",401,70,5,2026-02-08
"Excited to announce I've invested in Pelosi Capital. For years, my friend Nancy was distracted by her part-time job in politics. But after beating Warren Buffett's 10-year investment return by over 500% she's decided to make the jump to full-time investing. Her investment timing and knowledge of complex AI startups are so good that it almost seems like she has insider information. She spent decades as a loyal civil servant, but even in retirement, she's found a way to give back to society by managing people's investments. Honored to be her first investor and can't wait to see what she does next. P.S. Subscribe to my newsletter for the funniest tech & news satire: https://lnkd.in/ekGih-Hf",466,53,7,2026-02-01

"Yesterday, I found out that one of the founders I invested in was reading a self-help book. I immediately had him fired. If you have to get advice from other people, you're not fit to be a leader. The legendary founder Sam Bankman-Fried once said, ""I don't want to say no book is ever worth reading, but I don't want to say one is either."" Sam built a company worth $32B & didn't read a single book. Not only does reading waste time, but it signals that you don't know how to figure things out on your own. You can get all the best information on how to scale a business by watching Shark Tank on 2x speed. p.s. subscribe to my newsletter for the funniest business & world news: https://lnkd.in/ekGih-Hf",304,108,5,2026-02-01

"LinkedIn can be confusing. Let me translate some common buzzwords people use on their profiles: Thought leader - you have a 78 IQ & get all of your ""thoughts"" from podcasts. Creative problem solver - if you think your business has problems now, just wait until you hire someone who uses this phrase. Sales ninja - you couldn't sell a box of Girl Scout cookies to a 400-pound dude. Evangelist - you have no concrete skills but want people to think you're an expert at something (if you're a crypto evangelist, you probably used to steal wallets at a bar). To any of my followers who use these on their profile, I'm obviously not talking about you. I hope this helps. P.S.

"Here are 5 lessons from the Venezuelan invasion that made me a better CEO: 🎯Eliminate competition: Not everyone has access to a Delta Force Strike team, but everyone has access to predatory lawyers and private investigators. Drown your competition in questionable legal issues. 🏃‍➡️ Strike fast: Timing is everything, but don't wait to strike. Being the first to market with a product is a major advantage. Don't let your competition get ahead of you. ⁉️ Disregard ethics: If you have to ask your lawyers if you can do something, you're already losing. Do you think Microsoft cared about antitrust laws when they became #1? No, their profits paid for the legal defense. 💀 Minimize casualties: Obviously, I'm only talking about your own employees; re-hiring and training is expensive. It's only natural that your competitors' employees will be homeless by the time you're done with them. (Don't feel bad, Blackrock would have made them broke anyway) 💰Seize resources: Just like America seized Venezuela's oil, so China couldn't, Meta bought up all the Nvidia graphics cards so their competitors couldn't. Even if your company doesn't need something, your competitors might, and that means you're buying it. To all my loyal fans, I hope this helps. To all my competitors, I'm coming for you. P.S.
