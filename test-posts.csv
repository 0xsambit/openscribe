"Just shipped a major feature at work. Here's what I learned about shipping fast without breaking things: 1) Start with the smallest possible scope 2) Ship to 5% of users first 3) Monitor like crazy for 24 hours 4) Iterate based on real feedback. The biggest lesson? Perfect is the enemy of shipped.",142,28,12,2024-12-01
"5 lessons from my first year as an engineering manager: 1) Your job is to multiply the output of others not do the work yourself 2) 1-on-1s are sacred - never cancel them 3) Feedback should be frequent and specific 4) Celebrate wins publicly address issues privately 5) Your team's growth is your success metric. What would you add?",328,64,45,2024-11-15
"Hot take: Most best practices are just popular practices. What actually matters is understanding the WHY behind each decision. Context always beats dogma. Before adopting any practice ask: What problem does this solve? Does that problem exist in my context? What are the tradeoffs?",189,52,18,2024-10-20
"The biggest career mistake I see engineers make: optimizing for compensation instead of learning velocity. In your 20s and early 30s compound learning beats compound interest. Choose projects that scare you teams smarter than you technologies with momentum and problems worth solving 10 years from now.",256,71,34,2024-09-10
"I interviewed 50+ senior engineers last year. The #1 trait that separated the great ones? They could explain complex things simply. Technical depth is table stakes. Communication is the force multiplier. The best engineers write clear docs give crisp design reviews mentor juniors effectively and influence without authority.",403,98,67,2024-08-05
"Debugging is 90% Psychology 10% syntax. When stuck: 1) Rubber duck it 2) Take a walk 3) Check your assumptions 4) Read the error message carefully 5) Sleep on it. The bug that takes 3 hours at 11pm takes 10 minutes at 9am.",271,43,29,2024-07-12
"Your tech stack doesn't matter as much as you think. I've seen great products built on outdated tech and terrible products on the latest frameworks. What actually matters: solving a real problem shipping consistently listening to users iterating quickly and building a strong team. Choose boring technology.",198,39,21,2024-06-18
"Thread: How to run effective code reviews. 1) Code review is not about finding bugs. Static analysis does that better. It's about knowledge transfer learning and building shared context. 2) Review for readability first. If you can't understand it in 5 minutes it needs improvement.",312,58,41,2024-05-25
"The best career advice I got: Work on things that compound. Writing compounds - each post builds your reputation. Open source compounds - each contribution builds your portfolio. Teaching compounds - each person you help multiplies your impact. Consulting doesn't compound.",289,67,38,2024-04-30
"Unpopular opinion: Most startups don't need microservices. You need: a monolith that deploys fast good monitoring feature flags automated tests and fast CI/CD. Microservices are for solving organizational problems not technical ones. Start simple scale when you have the problem.",176,41,19,2024-03-15
