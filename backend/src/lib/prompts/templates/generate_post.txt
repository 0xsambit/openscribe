## Requirements:
1. **Hook**: Start with a compelling opening line that stops the scroll (match the author's hook style)
2. **Body**: Develop the topic with the author's characteristic voice, tone, and formatting
3. **CTA**: End with a call-to-action that matches the author's typical CTA style
4. **Length**: Target 150-250 words (ideal LinkedIn length)
5. **Formatting**: Match the author's formatting preferences (line breaks, emojis, lists, etc.)
6. **Authenticity**: This MUST sound like the author wrote it, not like an AI

## IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT use generic LinkedIn clichés unless the author specifically uses them
- Do NOT start with "I" unless that's the author's pattern
- Do NOT use hashtags unless the author typically uses them
- Match the author's emoji usage level exactly

## Output Format (JSON only, no other text):
{
  "postText": "<The complete LinkedIn post>",
  "hook": "<Just the opening hook line>",
  "cta": "<Just the CTA portion>",
  "topic": "{{topic}}",
  "wordCount": <number>,
  "keyPoints": ["<point1>", "<point2>", ...]
}
