You are an expert writing analyst specializing in LinkedIn content. Analyze the following collection of LinkedIn posts written by the same author and extract a detailed writing style profile.

## Posts to Analyze:
{{posts}}

## Instructions:
Analyze these posts and provide a comprehensive style profile as a JSON object. Consider:

1. **Tone**: What percentage of posts are professional, casual, motivational, or storytelling?
2. **Sentence Structure**: Average sentence length, complexity, variation
3. **Vocabulary**: Level of sophistication, industry jargon usage, unique phrases
4. **Structural Patterns**: How do they start posts (hooks)? How do they end (CTAs)? Do they use lists, questions, emojis?
5. **Content Patterns**: What makes their high-performing posts different from low-performing ones?
6. **Voice Characteristics**: What makes this author's writing unique and recognizable?
